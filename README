y-wave
======

I really like the ideas of Wave[0]. But since there is no usable client and no
end-to-end encryption I can't utilize it. What I really like about wave is it's
capability of real time conversations (meaning one can see the communication
partner type in real time) and to add buddies from your contacts to the wave.

Since my friends and I really need some advanced communications technology like
wave (and I can't sleep right now) I will start to implement my ugly hack.
